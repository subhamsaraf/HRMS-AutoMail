# HRMS-AutoMail
Automation  of the mail that come from the HRMS department


Step 1:
We need to create an automation system for the HRMS Department.
Everyone in that particular organization should get a mail of a particular event that has occurred,
might be a birthday or maybe work anniversary.

The mail should be generated automatically by the help of the fields that are present in that particular data base or may be it might be a file.

The records might be altered/added/deleted by HRMS department only.
There will be several Employees who would be capable of doing that,
Authorization of the User is really important.
Addition and update made by a particular employee of the HRMS Department should be mentioned.

Now our class needs to check the events that are set to our whole database/file,
If any events match then we need to print the result.
There will be a particular message for the particular event (override ToString())
